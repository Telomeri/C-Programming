This the instruction for file cleaning program written in c, which will remove the comments and empty rows from file, making it "cleaner".

1. To compile the program, locate the file with cmd and write "make all", which will spawn the needed .o files and the clean_files file.
2. After this, you can start the program by writing "./clean_files" at the commandline
3. A dialog will pop up asking you to enter the file name you want cleaned.
4. Move the file you want cleaned to the root folder (the location of this program), and enter its name into the cmd, don't forget the file type (e.g. .c)
5. If the file clean is succesful, it will print text saying so, if it was not, it will print the reason for this.
6. You can enter as many files as you want, and when you are done either write exit or use CTRL + C.
7. The files that have been cleaned will end with .clean, for example "helloworld.c.clean"
8. If you want to remove the .o files, you can use "make clean", which will remove all the .o and log files.
9. You can see the programs steps by checking the log file, but note that it will be deleted when you give the "make clean" command
